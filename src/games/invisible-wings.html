            &ldquo;A visual novel in which fairies pose a threat? Very nice idea and I really like the world building around it. Has a good serious undertone in many scenes, which reflects society and its difficulties well. [...] the structure that was built around it is more than solid and already makes you curious about the finished game.&rdquo;

          <h3 class="has-text-centered">Dawn</h3>
  
          <p>
            Dawn is a young female hybrid with one great wish: to be just an ordinary human. For years she has constantly been confronted with her appearance and heritage, even although she looks more human than other hybrids. She blames the faerie species for being an outcast in the human-dominated world and desperately tries to seek answers to her identity, but with little luck so far. It also doesn’t help that racism even went so far to not letting faeries and hybrids participate in official sport events, which clashes with Dawn’s great passion for figure skating. However, these issues only seem the beginning of Dawn’s journey...

          <h3 class="has-text-centered">Lilith</h3>
  
          <p>
            Being a faerie seems to be quite hard in a world dominated by human beliefs, especially for a social butterfly like Lilith. Few know however that she tries to cope with a past experience that forced her to leave her faerie tribe, giving her a dreamy, restless and sometimes impulsive personality. She tries to disguise this mental scar by being nice to everyone, but not always with success. Luckily Lilith has the advantage of possessing magic to hide her wings and tail from plain sight, something that also proves to be useful to enter the figure skating competition.

          <h3 class="has-text-centered">Aranea</h3>
  
          <p>
            Strongly led by her own ideals, Aranea is an ambitious hybrid who fights for equal rights for hybrids and a halt to the racism they undergo. She feels however a great resentment towards faeries, because in her opinion they took away a blissful future for her own species. Aranea is Dawn's best friend since their childhood and gives her a lot of support, but her own ideals seem conflicting with Dawn’s personal wish and maybe even with common moral sense...
