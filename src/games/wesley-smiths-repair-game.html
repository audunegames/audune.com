        <p>
          Welcome to Wesley Smith's Repair Game! Join self-declared blacksmith Wesley on his journey of collecting items and repairing weapons to show off his blacksmith skills. But if you already happen to have the weapons, you can use them for other things too, like getting rid of your annoying friends!
        </p>

        <p>
          Compete against the merciless bots or up to three friends in this couch co-op adventure of collecting items, crafting weapons and defeating your opponents! Chop off their body parts with a chainsaw, burn them to ash with a flamethrower, vacuum away their remains with a vacuum cleaner, or turn to the dark side with a laser sword! With a selection of 12 characters with unique bonuses, three mind-blowing game modes and 12 diverse arenas, Wesley Smith's Repair Game is guaranteed to be frustratingly fun!
        </p>

        <h4>Collecting and crafting</h4>

        <p>
          Collect various items and craft them into weapons at one of the shops to defeat your opponents. Search for food to replenish your health and collect various tools to increase your chances to become the master blacksmith!
        </p>

        <h4>Chests and frenzy drops</h4>

        <p>
          Once in a while a chest or a frenzy drop spawn up for grabs for anyone. Be sure to get your hands on those to get rare and precious goodies or to initiate a chain reaction of dropping items, chests, or deadly mines!
        </p>

        <h4>Multiple characters and game modes</h4>

        <p>
          Play as one of the 12 included characters, each with a different bonus or advantage, including the titular Wesley Smith and cameos from other games made by Audune Games. Also, no need to get bored of classic matches with the refreshing Weapon Rain and Minesweeper game modes!
        </p>

        <h4>Diverse arenas</h4>

        <p>
          Battle in one of the twelve hand-crafted 21x21 arenas in five themes, which can include pre-placed chests and portals to easily traverse great distances to escape from your opponents or to grab goodies from right under their noses. Alternatively, you can get adventurous and generate a random arena!
        </p>

        <h4>Awesome single player and local multiplayer fun</h4>

        <p>
          Compete in a solo match against merciless bots, or challenge your friends in a local multiplayer match with room for up to four people with guaranteed couch co-op fun!
        </p>
